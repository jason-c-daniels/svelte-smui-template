# Svelte SMUI Template

## Using this template
1. As a github template project  you can just click the "Use This Template" button.
2. Run `npx degit jason-c-daniels/svelte-smui-template your-project-name`
3. Download a zip of the master branch from github.

## Where to go from here
You'll need to modify `package.json` and `main.js` with the actual name of your application. 
(`main.js` passes it to the App component)  From there remove the default code and begin 
coding your own application.
